## What Works

### USB Functionality ✓
- USB OTG host mode operational
- USB keyboard enumeration and connection
- HID report parsing (modifier, key1, key2)
- Device connection/disconnection detection
- Keyboard input → CAN bus transmission (address 0x711)

### CAN Bus Functionality ✓
- CAN bus initialization (configurable speed: 125, 250, 500, 1000 kbps)
- Frame transmission with 0x711 address (buttons)
- Frame reception and routing
- Queue management (500 deep RX/TX)
- CAN state verification before transmission
- Retry logic for failed transmissions (5 attempts, 13ms delay)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Design Limitations (Accepted)
1. **Single Keyboard Only**: No USB hub support - one keyboard per device
2. **Runtime Configuration**: Most settings configurable, but some require restart (CAN speed, ECU ID)
3. **Fixed Protocol**: EPIC protocol is proprietary (cannot change protocol format)
4. **Single Diagnostic Session**: ISO version supports one session at a time
5. **SD Card Dependency**: High-speed logging causes SD card wear (mitigated by ring buffer)

### Minor Code Quality Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **ISO Buffer Size**: Large buffers (4KB) for ISO messages - acceptable for functionality
2. **Configuration Size**: Limited by ESP32 Preferences (75KB total) - adequate for current needs
3. **SD Recovery**: Periodic retry (every 10 seconds) - could be configurable

### Hardware Dependencies
1. **CAN Transceiver Required**: Not included on ESP32-S3-OTG board
2. **SD Card Required**: For logging functionality (optional - system works without it)
3. **External Power May Be Needed**: For high-power keyboards
4. **CAN Termination**: Requires proper 120Ω resistors at bus ends

### Operational Characteristics
1. **Restart Recovery Time**: ~2-3 seconds when error threshold hit (progressive recovery reduces frequency)
2. **Key Latency**: 10-50ms from keypress to CAN transmission (acceptable)
3. **Variable Update Rate**: 10-50ms per variable (depending on request interval config)
4. **SD Write Performance**: Non-blocking, time-budgeted to maintain CAN responsiveness
5. **ISO Overhead**: ~5-10% CPU when processing ISO messages (ISO version only)

### Resource Usage
- **Flash**: ~850KB (standard), ~920KB (ISO)
