# USB HID to CAN Bridge (USB_HID_CAN_BRIDGE)

## Project Overview

This firmware bridges USB keyboard input to CAN bus messages on an ESP32-S3 platform.
It receives keystrokes from a USB keyboard connected to the ESP32-S3 USB OTG port and 
transmits encoded key data over a CAN bus network using address 0x711 (CANBUS BUTTONBOX).

Key features:
- USB HID keyboard input via USB OTG
- CAN bus transmission at 500 kbps
- Modifier key support (shift, ctrl, alt)
- Visual status feedback via WS2812 RGB LED (Green=RX, Blue=TX)
- Automatic error recovery with restart on failure
- Serial debug output at 115200 baud

## Protocol Details

**CAN Message Format (Address 0x711):**
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 0x5A | Magic byte |
| 1 | 0x00 | Reserved |
| 2 | 27 | Fixed value |
| 3 | MSB | First key MSB (modifier encoding) |
| 4 | LSB | First key LSB (base keycode) |

**Key Encoding:**
- 16-bit value = `keycode + (modifier Ã— 0xFF)`
- Modifier byte includes shift, ctrl, alt, GUI keys
- Transmitted as LSB in byte 4, MSB in byte 3

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Keyboard not detected
- Check USB cable and connections
- Verify ESP32-S3 USB OTG port is functioning
- Try different keyboard
- Check serial output for enumeration messages

### Problem: No CAN messages transmitted
- Verify CAN transceiver connections (TX/RX pins)
- Check CAN bus termination (120Î© resistors)
- Monitor serial output for error messages
- Verify CAN bus voltage levels (2.5V idle, differential when active)

### Problem: System keeps restarting
- CAN bus error threshold exceeded (>30 errors)
- Check CAN bus wiring and termination
- Verify other CAN devices are operating correctly
