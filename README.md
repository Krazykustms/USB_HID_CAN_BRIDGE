# USB HID to CAN Bridge (USB_HID_CAN_BRIDGE)

## Project Overview

This firmware bridges USB keyboard input to CAN bus messages on an ESP32-S3 platform.
It receives keystrokes from a USB keyboard connected to the ESP32-S3 USB OTG port and 
transmits encoded key data over a CAN bus network using address 0x711 (CANBUS BUTTONBOX).

Key features:
- USB HID keyboard input via USB OTG
- CAN bus transmission at 500 kbps
- Modifier key support (shift, ctrl, alt)
- Visual status feedback via WS2812 RGB LED (Green=RX, Blue=TX)
- Automatic error recovery with restart on failure
- Serial debug output at 115200 baud

## Parts Needed

Ready to build? Here are the specific components needed for this project:

| Component | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **ESP32-S3-USB-OTG Board** | Official Espressif development board with USB OTG support and onboard WS2812 LED | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6HT7V7P) |
| **CAN Bus Transceiver Module** | TJA1050 or SN65HVD230 CAN controller interface module | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W4VZ2F2) |
| **USB Keyboard** | Any standard USB keyboard with HID protocol support | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JZ5FVLC) |
| **Jumper Wires** | Assorted male-to-male, male-to-female jumper wires for connections | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNZGHZH3) |

**Additional items you may need:**
- 5V power supply (USB-C cable and adapter for ESP32-S3)
- 12V power supply (if required by your CAN transceiver module)
- 120Œ© termination resistors (typically needed at both ends of CAN bus)

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-S3-USB-OTG development board (official Espressif board)
- CAN transceiver module (TJA1050 or MCP2551 - requires 5V; or SN65HVD230 - works with 3.3V)
- USB keyboard (standard HID protocol)
- 5V power supply for ESP32-S3
- **5V power source for CAN transceiver** (TJA1050/MCP2551 require 5V - use buck converter from 12V or ESP32 5V pin)
- CAN bus network with 120Œ© termination resistors at both ends

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issue:** TJA1050 and MCP2551 transceivers **require 5V**, not 3.3V. Without proper voltage, the transceiver cannot drive the CAN bus, causing transmission failures and system restarts.

## Hardware Setup Guide

Follow these steps to assemble the hardware. Images show the actual build process:

### Step 1: Prepare the Buck Converter (Optional Power Supply)

If using a buck converter to step down 12V to 5V for the ESP32-S3:

**Cut the trace on the buck converter to enable voltage adjustment:**

**Adjust the buck converter output to 5V and bridge the connection:**

**Align the buck converter with the development board pins:**

![Buck converter aligned with dev board](pics/buck-align-with-dev-board.png)

**Install the buck converter on the development board:**

### Step 2: Install the CAN Transceiver Module

**Identify the GPIO pins for CAN PHY connection (GPIO 4 and 5):**

### Step 3: Prepare the USB OTG Bridge (if needed)

**Solder the USB OTG bridge connections:**

### Wiring Summary

After following the above steps, your connections should be:

**ESP32-S3-USB-OTG to CAN Transceiver:**
- GPIO 5 (CAN_TX) ‚Üí CAN Transceiver RX pin
- GPIO 4 (CAN_RX) ‚Üí CAN Transceiver TX pin
- **5V ‚Üí CAN Transceiver VCC** (CRITICAL: TJA1050/MCP2551 require 5V, not 3.3V)
- GND ‚Üí CAN Transceiver GND

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** TJA1050 and MCP2551 transceivers require 5V power supply. Using 3.3V will cause the transceiver to fail, resulting in no CAN messages being transmitted and eventual system restart due to ACK timeout errors. The logic pins (TX/RX) are 3.3V tolerant.

**CAN Transceiver to CAN Bus:**
- CANH ‚Üí CAN Bus H line
- CANL ‚Üí CAN Bus L line

**Power Supply:**
- 5V power to ESP32-S3 (via USB-C or buck converter)
- 12V to buck converter (if using external power)

- üîµ Blue flash: CAN message being transmitted
- ‚ö´ No light: Idle, waiting for input

## Protocol Details

**CAN Message Format (Address 0x711):**
| Byte | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 0x5A | Magic byte |
| 1 | 0x00 | Reserved |
| 2 | 27 | Fixed value |
| 3 | MSB | First key MSB (modifier encoding) |
| 4 | LSB | First key LSB (base keycode) |

**Key Encoding:**
- 16-bit value = `keycode + (modifier √ó 0xFF)`
- Modifier byte includes shift, ctrl, alt, GUI keys
- Transmitted as LSB in byte 4, MSB in byte 3

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Keyboard not detected
- Check USB cable and connections
- Verify ESP32-S3 USB OTG port is functioning
- Try different keyboard
- Check serial output for enumeration messages

### Problem: No CAN messages transmitted
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MOST COMMON:** Verify CAN transceiver has **5V power** (TJA1050/MCP2551 require 5V, not 3.3V)
- Verify CAN transceiver connections (TX/RX pins)
- Check CAN bus termination (120Œ© resistors)
- Ensure at least one other device is on the CAN bus to ACK messages
- Monitor serial output for error messages
- Verify CAN bus voltage levels (2.5V idle, differential when active)

### Problem: System keeps restarting
- CAN bus error threshold exceeded (>30 errors)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK FIRST:** Verify CAN transceiver has **5V power** (not 3.3V)
- **CHECK SECOND:** Ensure another device is on the CAN bus to acknowledge messages
- Check CAN bus wiring and termination
- Verify other CAN devices are operating correctly
- Check power supply stability
