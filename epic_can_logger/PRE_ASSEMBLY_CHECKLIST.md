## ðŸš¨ Critical Safety Reminders

### Before First Power-On:
1. **Verify NO short circuits** between 5V and GND
2. **Check strapping pins** not accidentally connected:
   - GPIO 0 (Boot) - must be HIGH
   - GPIO 9 (Flash CS) - must be HIGH
   - GPIO 46 (Boot) - must be LOW
3. **Verify power polarity** (red = +, black = -)
4. **Double-check CAN TX/RX** (they cross: TXâ†’RX, RXâ†’TX)
5. **Verify CAN transceiver voltage** matches type

### During Assembly:
1. **Work one module at a time**
2. **Test after each major section**
3. **Don't rush** - mistakes cost time
4. **Take photos** for reference
5. **Label wires** as you go

## ðŸŽ¯ Assembly Order Recommendation

1. âœ… **Power distribution** (ESP32 + breadboard rails)
2. âœ… **CAN transceiver** (power + signals)
3. âœ… **SD card module** (power + SPI)
4. âœ… **Shift light LED** (GPIO 14 + resistor)
5. âœ… **Button array** (8 buttons)
6. âœ… **USB OTG** (keyboard connection)
7. âœ… **Final testing** (power-on + verification)
