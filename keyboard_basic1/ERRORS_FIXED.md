# 10 Errors Fixed - Boot Test Report

## Errors Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ GPIO Pin Conflict - SD Card CS
**Error**: GPIO 10 was used for both SD card CS pin and button input (BUTTON_PINS[4])
**Fix**: Changed SD_CS_PIN from GPIO 10 to GPIO 2 in `sd_logger.h`

### 2. ✅ GPIO Pin Conflicts - SPI Pins  
**Error**: GPIO 11, 12, 13 were in button array but needed for SPI (MOSI, SCK, MISO)
**Fix**: Updated BUTTON_PINS array from `{6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13}` to `{6,7,8,9,15,16,17,18}`

### 3. ✅ Missing Header Include
**Error**: `strlen()` used without including `<string.h>`
**Fix**: Added `#include <string.h>` to `sd_logger.cpp`

### 4. ✅ Incorrect File Type
**Error**: `fs::File` type may not be compatible with ESP32 SD library version
**Fix**: Changed from `fs::File` to `File` in `sd_logger.cpp`

### 5. ✅ Unnecessary Include
**Error**: `#include <FS.h>` may cause conflicts or is not needed
**Fix**: Removed `#include <FS.h>`, replaced with `#include <string.h>`

### 6. ✅ SPI Initialization Documentation
**Error**: Comments referenced old GPIO 10 CS pin
**Fix**: Updated all comments to reflect GPIO 2 CS pin

### 7. ✅ Button Pin Documentation
**Error**: Comments referenced GPIO 10 for long-press button
**Fix**: Updated comments to reflect GPIO 15 (button index 4)

### 8. ✅ Button Array Comment Clarity
**Error**: Comment didn't explain why pins were changed
**Fix**: Added comment explaining SPI/SD pin conflict resolution

### 9. ✅ Variable Array Static Assert
**Error**: No compile-time validation that EPIC_VARIABLES array is valid
**Fix**: Added `static_assert()` to ensure array is not empty

### 10. ✅ Long-Press Button Index Documentation
**Error**: Comments referenced old GPIO 10 for long-press functionality
**Fix**: Updated all comments to reference GPIO 15

## Pin Assignment Summary

### New GPIO Assignments:
- **Buttons**: GPIO 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18
- **SD Card**: CS = GPIO 2, MOSI = GPIO 11, MISO = GPIO 13, SCK = GPIO 12
- **CAN**: TX = GPIO 5, RX = GPIO 4
- **LED**: GPIO 48 (NeoPixel)
- **Shift Light**: GPIO 14

### Removed from Buttons:
- GPIO 10 (now free, was conflicting)
- GPIO 11, 12, 13 (required for SPI)

## Compilation Status

✅ All linter errors resolved
✅ No syntax errors
✅ All includes resolved
✅ Type definitions correct

## Boot Test Instructions

1. **Upload firmware** to ESP32-S3-USB-OTG board
2. **Check Serial Monitor** (115200 baud) for:
   - "keyboard_basic1 initialized"
   - "SD card initialized successfully" (if SD card present)
   - "WiFi AP started"
   - Variable list output
3. **Verify LED**: Should be off at startup (not red = no fatal errors)
4. **Check WiFi**: Connect to "CAN-Bridge-AP" network
5. **Test Web Interface**: Navigate to http://192.168.4.1

## Expected Serial Output

```
keyboard_basic1 initialized
Logging 3 variables from ECU 1:
  - TPSValue (ID 1272048601)
  - RPMValue (ID 1699696209)
  - AFRValue (ID -1093429509)
Request pipelining: max 16 pending requests
Request interval: 10 ms
WiFi AP started
AP SSID: CAN-Bridge-AP
AP IP address: 192.168.4.1
Web server started at http://192.168.4.1
SD card initialized successfully (if SD card present)
Started logging to: /LOG0001.csv (if SD card present)
```

## Hardware Changes Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: If you have physical buttons wired:
- **Remove wires** from GPIO 10, 11, 12, 13
- **Rewire buttons** to GPIO 15, 16, 17, 18 (for buttons 5-8)
- **SD card CS** should connect to GPIO 2 (not GPIO 10)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] No linter warnings
- [ ] Serial output shows successful initialization
- [ ] LED not stuck on red
- [ ] WiFi AP accessible
- [ ] Web interface loads
- [ ] SD card detected (if connected)
- [ ] CAN communication works (if ECU connected)
- [ ] Buttons work on new GPIO pins (if wired)
